    "Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,\" is a linear regression technique that incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of models. Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression objective function, which encourages the model to reduce the coefficients of some predictors to exactly zero. This leads to automatic feature selection, as some predictors are entirely excluded from the model.\n"

    " Lasso Regression's feature selection advantage is powerful, it's important to note that it also has limitations. For example, when predictors are highly correlated, Lasso might arbitrarily select one of the correlated predictors and exclude the others. In such cases, Ridge Regression or Elastic Net Regression (a combination of Lasso and Ridge) might be more suitable. Overall, the choice between Lasso and other regression techniques depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis."

    " Here's how you can interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnitude and Sign of Coefficients:\n",
    "Just like in linear regression, the magnitude (size) and sign (positive or negative) of the coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each predictor and the target variable. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the predictor value is associated with an increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient indicates the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient Value:\n",
    "The magnitude of the coefficient reflects the strength of the relationship between the predictor and the target, while considering the effect of other predictors and the regularization term. Larger magnitude coefficients have a larger impact on the predicted outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Coefficients:\n",
    "Lasso Regression's key feature is its ability to drive some coefficients to exactly zero, performing automatic feature selection. A coefficient of zero indicates that the corresponding predictor has been excluded from the model. This is particularly useful for identifying less relevant predictors and simplifying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Zero Coefficients:\n",
    "Non-zero coefficients indicate the predictors that have been retained in the model. These predictors contribute to the model's predictions and are considered important based on the Lasso's feature selection process"

Additionally, in the context of Elastic Net Regression (a combination of Lasso and Ridge), there's another tuning parameter (\n",

    "Lasso Regression is primarily designed for linear regression problems, where the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. However, with some modifications and techniques, you can extend Lasso Regression to handle non-linear regression problems to a certain extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Features:\n",
    "One way to introduce non-linearity in Lasso Regression is by creating polynomial features. You can transform your original features into polynomial terms (e.g., squaring, cubing) to capture non-linear relationships. After generating polynomial features, you can apply Lasso Regression as usual. However, this approach may lead to more complex models and is prone to overfitting, especially when the degree of the polynomial is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis Expansion:\n",
    "Basis expansion involves transforming your original features using non-linear functions such as exponentials, logarithms, or trigonometric functions. By transforming the features into a new basis, you can introduce non-linearity in the model. After applying basis expansion, you can use Lasso Regression to fit the transformed features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel Regression:\n",
    "Kernel regression is a technique that involves mapping the original features into a higher-dimensional space using kernel functions. This can capture complex non-linear relationships between variables. You can then apply Lasso Regression in the transformed space. Kernel methods can be computationally intensive and require careful selection of kernel functions.\n"
